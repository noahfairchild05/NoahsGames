        <p>Call of Duty:Black Ops 6 has to be number one. Ive had so much fun playing this game. The matches
            are short and you can get in and out of games easily. Just simple fun.</p>

        <p>Deadlock came up out of nowhere and instantly became a top game. From playing SMITE to LoL, deadlock is the perfect mix of MOBA with a TP shooter.</p>

        <p>Rocket League will always be in the top of my list. However, this year, COD and Deadlock outshine it.</p>
