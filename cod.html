    <p>Now THIS is the OG.</p>
    <p>Me and my friends never really played a COD game together. I usually played sometimes alone, other than warzone.</p>
    <p>We did have a little spell when we would play a bit of Warzone. It was pretty fun, but battle royale's are just not my thing.</p>
    <p>However, we all have been playing BO6 and have had a blast. It is one of the best ones to come out recently, and we all enjoy it.</p>
