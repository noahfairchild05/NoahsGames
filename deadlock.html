        <div class="DL">
        <p>Deadlock is a new game this year, 2024, that has popped up out of nowhere.</p>
        <p>The game is made by Valve, and is still in its early stages of alpha testing.</p>
        <p>My friends and I have already poured hundreds of hours into Deadlock, and we always have fun playing.</p>
        <p>One thing I don't like about the game, is how long the matches last. I know its normal for MOBAs to last longer, bit nowadays I just don't have the patience.</p>
        <p>The game is amazing, but I think I'm burnt out for a while.</p>
